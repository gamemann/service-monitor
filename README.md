# WIP & Not Completed
A simple service monitor written in Rust that supports monitoring supported services such as websites (via HTTP/HTTPS requests) and if an error occurs (e.g. timeout or invalid status code), will trigger an alert for a specific service such as Discord.

## My Motives
I tried learning Rust a couple of years ago, but unfortunately never stuck with it. However, since I will most likely be using Rust in the future for my job, I need/want to relearn it. I figured a good starting point is to create this service monitor that I will be using for my [modding project](https://moddingcommunity.com)!

I'm pretty much *winging* Rust on this project. I haven't read much documentation on Rust and wanted to see how far I can go by Googling, using AI (to explain code and why we use x, y, and z).
